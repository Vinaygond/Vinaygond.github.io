So the obvious question to start with is what exactly is a data structure? Well in Computer Science, 
a data structure is a way to store, organize, and manage information -or data- in a way that allows you the programmer to easily access or modify the values within them. Essentially, it’s a way for us to store a set of related information that we can then use for our programs. Data Structures, and the algorithms used to interact, modify, and search through them provide the backbone for many of the programs you’ll end up writing. I can almost guarantee that in 99% of your programs, a data structure will be involved. Each of the data structures we’ll be talking about are designed for the sole purpose of storing information and allowing the end user to access and manipulate that information in an efficient and effective way, but each one differs in the manner that they accomplish this.
